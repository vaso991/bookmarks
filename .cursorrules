# Cursor Rules for Bookmarks Project

This is a technical reference and documentation repository containing guides, cheatsheets, and bookmarks for software engineering concepts.

## Project Structure
- Documentation is organized by topic in dedicated directories (databases/, http/, networking/, system-design/)
- Each topic has a markdown file (.md) and may include supporting images (.jpeg, .png, .gif)
- The README.md serves as the index/navigation for all topics

## Writing Guidelines

### Markdown Formatting
- Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation files
- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags for code examples
- Include tables when presenting structured information (like HTTP status codes)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity

### Content Standards
- Write clear, concise explanations suitable for quick reference
- Include practical examples and use cases when relevant
- Maintain technical accuracy - verify information before adding
- Keep content focused and scannable (this is a reference guide, not a tutorial)
- Use proper technical terminology consistently

### File Organization
- Follow existing naming conventions (kebab-case for markdown files: status-codes.md, system-design.md)
- Place related images in the same directory as the markdown file
- Update README.md when adding new topics or sections
- Keep directory structure flat and organized by topic

### Code Examples
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Keep examples concise and relevant
- Include comments in code examples when they add clarity
- Use real-world, practical examples over abstract ones

## When Adding New Content
- Create a new directory for the topic if it doesn't exist
- Add an entry to README.md with a brief description
- Follow the existing structure and formatting patterns
- Ensure cross-references and links are accurate

## When Editing Existing Content
- Maintain consistency with existing style and structure
- Preserve the reference/cheatsheet nature of the content
- Update related sections if making significant changes
- Keep formatting consistent with the rest of the file
